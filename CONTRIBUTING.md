#### `yarn test`

### Internationalization

This project uses [react-intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl) library for Internationalization. Check out the repos documentation for more information of how it works. In a nutshell - all the localized strings are in `src/locale` directory and you have access to them via either intl prop or "Formated" components. In case you would like to add some text, please add a new key(s) to `<locale>.json`.

A sample scenario for adding a new key:

1. Add a key(s) to `src/locale/en.json`. The naming convetion for the keys are <module/location>. (camelCased) e.g.:

   ```
   // src/locale/en.json
   {
     ...
     "example.helloWorld": "Hello, world!"
   }
   ```

2. Use `<FormattedMessage />` component from react-intl to display the text

   ```
   import React from 'react';
   import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl';

   const Example = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         <FormattedMessage id="example.helloWorld" defaultMessage="Hello, world!" />
       </div>
     )
   }

   export default Example;
   ```
