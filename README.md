Cara Care is a mobile app that allows people with chronic stomach disorders to track the food they consume and get advised by professional nutritionists to improve their condition.

This repository is an open source web-app bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) that allows Cara Care users and nutritionists to view and share the tracking data entered in the app.
